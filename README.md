Reflection
Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed prepared me to complete the assignment.

If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would add additional features like sign up/ log in and a working database. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

During my project demo, my project loaded well and the features loaded properly.


### Shout out
I would like to shout out to Greg Miller, my Tech Fellow who helped me go through a problem that I had. 
I would also like to shout out to Kaushik Mishra, my Intern Peer who helped me look through my code to ensure it is clean and helped me prepare for my demo.
Shout out to Vaneesa Ezeh and Mercy Fisayo Akinyemi, my metaU peers.
